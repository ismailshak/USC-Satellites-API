# USC Satellites API

For project two assigned at General Assembly, I decided to create an API based on research gathered by the Union of Concerned Scientists. It holds accurate information on all satellites in orbit (as of 4/1/19). 

I downloaded and parsed through the excel file, which can find [here](https://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/space-weapons/satellite-database "USC Website") 

I seeded my dabatase and created an API based on the information they gathered.

## Planning

For all planning ideas and proposals, visit the [planning directory's md file](https://github.com/ismailshak/USC-Satellites-API/blob/master/planning/proposedIdea.md). The planning directory also holds the javascript file used to parse through the source data and fragment it into manageable parts.

The [srcData](https://github.com/ismailshak/USC-Satellites-API/blob/master/srcData) contains all source files used to create my API
